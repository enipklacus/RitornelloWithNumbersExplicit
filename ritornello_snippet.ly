%%SNIPPET STARTS
%
%There are three functions: ritornelloCore, ritornello and ritornelloPivot. Core is the engine behind the latter two. Ritornello is a repeat volta with markups when unfolded; Pivot is the same but with a markup after the end of the repeting (i.e, the next measure after the repeat).
%To use this snippet you need to call the function and remove certain tags: unScore (when dealing with folded scores), folScore (when dealing with unfolded scores) and sectionInd (when dealing with multi staff instruments - like guitars, which use normal staffs and tablature staffs).
%
%I've co-designed this snippet (with help from ChatGPT and the Lilypond user community - special thanks to Yoshiaki Onishi). I've written the Lilypond code; the Scheme code was made by ChatGPT and Yoshiaki made a suggestion with regards to the markup code (which is implemented).
